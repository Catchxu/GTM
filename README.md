# Large-scale gene topic modeling for single-cell multi-omics analysis and retrieval
The success of language models in natural language processing for understanding and analyzing text has led to the development of numerous downstream applications. Just as text is composed of words, single-cell multi-omics data is similarly composed of gene read counts, forming gene expression profiles. However, existing gene language models, inspired by these language models, tend to focus only on the representation learning of single-cell multi-omics, and the lack of downstream tasks has hindered their generalization and application. Here, we introduce GTM, which employs large-scale pretrained topic models in the gene embedding space. Guided by our method, existing gene language models can enable the pathological and biological interpretation of single-cell multi-omics and support data-driven and intelligent dataset retrieval under the customization requirements without expert annotations. Thus, GTM not only helps non-biologists more easily understand single-cell multi-omics but also assists users in finding the datasets that best meet their specific requirements amid the growing volume of single-cell data.
